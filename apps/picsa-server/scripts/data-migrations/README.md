# Data Migrations

This folder contains small utility scripts used when first migrating hardcoded app data to database formats

See the `example.quokka.ts` file for an example of how hardcoded data can be run through migration functions with output written locally, using VSCode Quokka Extension to process data in memory.

Outputs are written to csv and json in the same folder as the scripts.

Migration code for specific data tables can be found in other files in the rest of the files
