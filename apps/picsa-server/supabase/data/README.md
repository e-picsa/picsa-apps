# Server Data

(TODO - move to docs page)

Files in this folder will be used to seed database when running locally

## Storage

All files in the `storage` folder will be uploaded to the server, along with any files in the `shared-assets` directory.

The storage folder should primarily be used for files which are used on the server but not in the app (e.g. monitoring form xlsx versions)

## Database

All `.csv` files will be imported into corresponding database tables
