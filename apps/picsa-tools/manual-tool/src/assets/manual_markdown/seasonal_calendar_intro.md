## Activity sheet A2 - How to construct a Seasonal Calendar

### What are Seasonal Calendars used for?

In this field manual we use Seasonal Calendars to enable farmers to explore:

a) the timing of the main activities (crop, livestock and livelihood) that they carry out on their
farms,  
b) how these are influenced by weather and climate, and
c) how extra information on the weather and climate could help.

In addition, Seasonal Calendars are used by farmers to provide a rough plan for what they intend to do
in the next season
