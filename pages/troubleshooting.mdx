# Troubleshooting

- File Opener is not currently supported [Issue](https://github.com/pwlin/cordova-plugin-file-opener2/issues/256), current workaround is to run jetify

```
npx jetify
```

- `Error: leaflet-draw@github:enketo/Leaflet.draw#ff73078: Couldn't resolve "ff73078"`
  This is because yarn can't resolve short commits used in enketo-core. Manually add resolution to yarn.lock

```
"leaflet-draw@github:enketo/Leaflet.draw#ff73078":
  version: 1.0.4
  resolution: "leaflet-draw@https://github.com/enketo/Leaflet.draw.git#commit=ff730785db7fcccbf2485ffcf4dffe1238a7c617"

### Cannot run jest tests against monitoring-tool

Known issue, related to how jest will attempt to recompile prior to running. Have tried many workarounds, but to no success

- https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/issues/1625
- https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object
- https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/issues/1648

Will likely need to fork and rebuild repo to add better support (assuming esm module syntax)

### Play store rejected - sensitive permissions 

**(REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES )**

Update `apps\picsa-apps\extension-app-native\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml` to remove permission

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES" tools:node="remove"/>
```

This will also require adding `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` in manifest tag
