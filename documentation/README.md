The documentation has moved to:
https://github.com/e-picsa/docs

Live docs are viewable at https://docs.picsa.app

If you have cloned the docs repo directly to a sibling folder you should be able to start directly from this workspace by the `yarn docs` shortcut, or open in vscode via `yarn docs:edit`

├── docs  
├── picsa-apps

_Recommended folder structure for working with docs and picsa-apps repo_
